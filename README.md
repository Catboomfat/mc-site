# Centural.us
A website with complete Minecraft integration through the use of a remote console (RCON) and possible by other means.

This repo should remain private until a complete launch has occured. Then we MUST have a working copy of that version posted as public on GitHub or a similar site/service.

To invite a friend to work on the project please have them contact an Operator. The Operator List can be found on the shared google drive.

Requirments to develop:
- Knowledge of Javascript,HTML,CSS, etc. (Basically you can learn to read and write any language we may need for the project)
- Large amount of game-time and/or personal interaction with Operators. (We do not wish to have bad code additions for malicious reasons)
- Passion for the game/community.

Though please still have your friends contact an Operator even if they do not meet one or more of the requirments as each case is reviewed differently.

# Goals

-Determine a way to store a private key on github...?
-A nice website.
