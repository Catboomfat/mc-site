<center><h1>About Centural</h1></center>
Centural aims to become a place for all things fun; 
A platform to help both Players and Streamers publish, maintain, and enjoy a variety of Game Servers for as low of a cost as possible (Sometimes even Free!) 
In-order to achieve this we plan to integrated Distributed Ledger Technologies into our mainframe to handle the load that certain game servers may have. 
The end goal is to have a community of game servers were data can be easily maintained, migrated, and claimed to their rightful owners. 
Currently we only support Minecraft Server hosting (Bedrock and Java Edition) but plan to host game servers for ANY game that has support to do so.
